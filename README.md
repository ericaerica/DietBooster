##Introduction
**The context.** Recently, many people have started seeking information about food and diets in order to know better what they eat; to this end, the Internet is a great and mostly used resource, thus many websites already exist which provide personalized nutritional information.
**The problem.** We noticed, however, that the level of personalization is not high enough to tell the users how to properly integrate the nutrients in which they lack; in other words, how to ”patch” their diet. For this purpose, we thought that a recommender system would do the work.
**The solution.** With our web application, the user can track his/her own diet through a meal plan on a daily basis; the system analyses the meal plan of a day and provides suggestions on how to improve it based on profile information and food habits.
